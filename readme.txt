Use an easy shortcode - [wonder-fontawesome icon=""] - for your quick font awesome needs!. Place this shortcode in your content, with your desired icon name (and optionally margin and font-size), and watch your icon show up on the front end. Updated to include FontAwesome 6. Check out https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free or https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands&m=free to find icon names. Visit https://wonderjarcreative.com/plugins/ for more info.
